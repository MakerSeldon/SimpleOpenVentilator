# Air Pressure Delivery

* Simple is best.
* We used a shop vac with a 2" hose and a HEPA filter.

# Coupling ShopVac to 2" PVC
Normal Shop vac adapters are for the suction side of the vac. We need the exhaust side to hook into the system. So those wont work, but lucky for us there are ready made parts to hook them up.

You need the following parts:
* Shop vac with 2" hose and extensions
* 2" Compression fitting Coupler
  the one that is about 8" long and has screw on caps at both ends and rubber gaskets
* a cutting tool

# Assembly
- Hook the hose up to the exhaust.
- Hook one extension to the hose.  
- Hook the second extension to the first one.
- Lay the compression down next to the second extension
- Examine the extension and guess where the extension is much smaller than the compression fitting.
- Cut it off there.
- Take the nut and rubber gasket off the compression fitting.
- slide the nut onto the extension
- slide the rubber gasket onto the extension
- try and stuff the rest of the compression fitting on. You may have to trim the vac extension a bit more. If it doesn't go on you have another extension to try.
- Assemble with the hose extension in one side and the 2" PVC on the other side.

You know can blow air into the 2" pipe.
